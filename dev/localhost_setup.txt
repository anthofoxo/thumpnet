!!! Warnings !!!

Wamp by default is setup for a development environment and
is not secure for public use without modification.

!!! Installation !!!

You do not have access to the cdn or mysql database when running locally.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/ is highly suggested.
You should NOT host your local version publically.

Pay attention and read the warning when installing!

You likely do not have the requied VC++ packages installed. If you're promted to install them.
https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/files/vcpackages/all_vc_redist_x86_x64.zip

Once installed. You may start up wampserver. You should see a green icon in your system tray.
If this is the case, everything is running and the server is accessable at `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
The default wampserver page will display.

!!! Adding the virtual host !!!
Virual hosts allow once server to serve from multiple domain names.
We add one here so it won't conflict with wampserver's default website or any others you may have.
open `http://localhost/add_vhost.php`
enter all the information you want, its highly recommended to setup a 127.x.y.z address for this.
Create the virtual host, then restart dns (right click the system trap icon, tools, first item "restart dns")
The virutalhost is now available at the specified address

If you visit the address you should see a blank directory listing.
Simply cut and paste the the entire thumpnet repo into this directory.

Reload and the basic website should display. You should expect see a http 500 error in the console.
This is due the api failing to connect to a database.

!!! Database !!!
Log into http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
username: root, password is empty. (security of this doesnt matter, its local ^^)

you may either do this with the sql tab and manually submit queries or use the gui.
For simplicity the sql queries will be shown.

CREATE DATABASE `databasename`;
USE `databasename`;
CREATE TABLE `users` (`id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `username` VARCHAR(32) NOT NULL, `password` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`id`), UNIQUE(`username`));
CREATE TABLE `levels` (`id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `uploader` INT NOT NULL, `cdn` VARCHAR(64) NULL, `name` VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL, `difficulty` INT NULL, `authors` JSON NULL, `description` TINYTEXT NULL, `thumb` VARCHAR(64) NULL, `extra` JSON NULL, PRIMARY KEY(`id`), FOREIGN KEY(`uploader`) REFERENCES `users`(`id`));
INSERT INTO `users` (`username`, `password`) VALUES ('username', 'password'); // This is your local login for thumpnet
INSERT INTO `levels` (`uploader`, `cdn`, `name`, `difficulty`, `authors`, `description`, `thumb`) VALUES ('1', 'test.zip', 'test', '0', '[1]', 'Test', 'thumb.png');

This is enough to get the api to respond with data. However the api doesnt know your sql login information.
create `api/mysqli.ini`

Contents of this file should be as follows, but data replaced with the details you used

[db]
hostname = "localhost"
username = "root"
password = ""
database = "databasename"

--- Apache modules ---
For protecting some files, the Order directive is used, this is disabled by default
goto the tray icon->apache->httpd.conf, search this line and uncomment it
`LoadModule access_compat_module modules/mod_access_compat.so`
restart all services and access /api and see if you get a reply

--- Create the cdn ---
Create a `cdn` folder and put the thumbnail/level into it, this will match the sql query above
